## Installation Guide

Follow these simple steps to install the extension from GitHub onto your Chrome browser.

### Step 1: Download the Extension Files
1. Click on the green "Code" button at the top of the GitHub repository page.
2. Choose the **Download ZIP** option to download the extension files to your computer.
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer (you will need this folder in the next steps).

### Step 2: Enable Developer Mode in Chrome
1. Open the **Chrome** browser on your computer.
2. In the address bar, type `chrome://extensions/` and press **Enter**.
3. At the top right, toggle the switch for **Developer mode** to turn it on. You should see additional options such as "Load unpacked" appear at the top.

### Step 3: Load the Extension
1. On the **Extensions** page (`chrome://extensions/`), click the **Load unpacked** button.
2. A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files in Step 1, select the folder, and click **Select Folder** (on Windows) or **Open** (on macOS).

### Step 4: Pin the Extension (Optional)

2. Find the **Auto Refresh** extension and click the pin icon next to it to keep it visible in your browser toolbar.

## How to Use the Extension

1. **Open the extension** by clicking on the Auto Refresh icon in your Chrome toolbar.
2. **Set the refresh interval**:
   - Enter the number of seconds for how often you want the page to automatically refresh.
3. **Optional: Set a stop word**:
   - Enter a word or phrase that, if found on the page, will automatically stop the refreshing. Leave this field blank if you donâ€™t want the page to stop refreshing.
4. **Start the auto-refresh**:
   - Click the **Start Auto Refresh** button to begin refreshing the current webpage at the set interval.
5. **Stop the auto-refresh**:
   - To stop the auto-refresh manually, click the **Stop Auto Refresh** button.

### Example Use Case:
- Set a webpage to refresh every 10 seconds while waiting for a specific word (like "available" or "sold out") to appear. The extension will stop refreshing automatically when it finds that word.

## Troubleshooting

If the extension is not working as expected:
- Ensure that **Developer mode** is enabled in Chrome.
- Make sure you have selected the correct folder when loading the extension.
- Verify that you've entered a valid interval (at least 1 second).
