Auto Refresh Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension allows you to automatically refresh a webpage every X seconds (as set by you) and stop refreshing when a specific word or phrase is found on the page.

Features
Automatically refresh a webpage at set intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).
Optionally stop the auto-refresh when a specific word or phrase appears on the page.

Follow these simple steps to install the extension from GitHub onto your Chrome browser.

Step 1: Download the Extension Files
Click on the green "Code" button at the top of the GitHub repository page.

Step 2: Enable Developer Mode in Chrome
Open the Chrome browser on your computer.
In the address bar, type chrome://extensions/ and press Enter.
At the top right, toggle the switch for Developer mode to turn it on. You should see additional options such as "Load unpacked" appear at the top.
Step 3: Load the Extension
On the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/), click the Load unpacked button.
A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files in Step 1, select the folder, and click Select Folder (on Windows) or Open (on macOS).

How to Use the Extension
Open the extension by clicking on the Auto Refresh icon in your Chrome toolbar.
Set the refresh interval:
Enter the number of seconds for how often you want the page to automatically refresh.
Optional: Set a stop word:
Enter a word or phrase that, if found on the page, will automatically stop the refreshing. Leave this field blank if you donâ€™t want the page to stop refreshing.
Start the auto-refresh:
Click the Start Auto Refresh button to begin refreshing the current webpage at the set interval.
Stop the auto-refresh:
To stop the auto-refresh manually, click the Stop Auto Refresh button.
Example Use Case:
Set a webpage to refresh every 10 seconds while waiting for a specific word (like "available" or "sold out") to appear. The extension will stop refreshing automatically when it finds that word.
Troubleshooting
If the extension is not working as expected:

Ensure that Developer mode is enabled in Chrome.
Make sure you have selected the correct folder when loading the extension.
Verify that you've entered a valid interval (at least 1 second).
